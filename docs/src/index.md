# NFFT.jl

*Julia package for the Non-equidistant Fast Fourier Transform*

## Introduction

This package provides a Julia implementation of the Non-equidistant Fast Fourier Transform (NFFT).
For a detailed introduction into the NFFT and its application please have a look at [www.nfft.org](http://www.nfft.org).

The NFFT is a fast implementation of the Non-equidistant Discrete Fourier Transform (NDFT) that is
basically a DFT with non-equidistant sampling nodes in either Fourier or time/space domain.
In contrast to the FFT, the NFFT is an approximative algorithm whereas the accuracy can be controlled
by two parameters: the window width `m` and the oversampling factor `sigma`.

## Installation

Start julia and open the package mode by entering `]`. Then enter
```julia
add NFFT
```
This will install the packages `NFFT.jl` and all its dependencies.
